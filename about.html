								<h3>Who am I?</h3>
									<p>
										I was born in San Diego, but grew up in Calgary until I was about 12 when I returned to San Diego where I went to highschool and have lived ever since.
										My data and computer science interest didn't start until towards the end of my freshman year at UC San Diego, when I realized
										I had a love for data and statistics after having a look at my own data records in a few different applications I used like Spotify, Google,
										and a few different video games I was playing at the time. It was this discovery that eventually led me to study Data Science at
										UC San Diego and to discover machine learning and its wide array of applications. I even went on to revisit Spotify data when
										working on my capstone project about playlist recommendation. Whether it is extracting useful insights from datasets, ensuring
										good data flow from databases, or creating neural network architectures for predictive modeling, I love to work with data and
										learn from it.

								<h4>Employment</h4>
								<b> Data Consultant - VSNew (Nov. 2021 - Current)</b>
								<p>
									During my senior year I landed a data consultant internship role at a startup called VSNew, where I gained a lot of hands-on
									experience. My work involved handling large datasets on Azure data studio with SQL, and loading subsets into python where I transformed
									the data in different ways to extract new features and analyze existing ones. Much of the data was time series sequential data from tests
									which I had to visualize.
								</p>
								<p>
									Aside from technical experience, I learned what it is like to handle a few different roles in a company, and work well with teammates
									that I had never met face to face and how to properly communicate different issues and make sure everything worked as it was supposed to.
								</p>

								<b> Lifeguard - YMCA (Apr. 2017 - Apr.2020) </b>
								<p>
									Until closures from COVID-19 I worked as a lifeguard at Palomar YMCA where I had to manage different parts of the pool deck, excerise proper
									rescue and safety protocol, and maintain good connections with patrons.
